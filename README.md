# Hands-on: Message Brokers

This project contains two folders, `event-driven` and `pipes-and-filters` each for their respective approach.
Despite the differences in approaches, the building and usage process is almost identical.

## ðŸ”¨ Build process

> Before starting either of approaches, make sure to create `.env` file in either/both of the folders that contains `EMAIL_ADDRESS` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` as shown in `.env.example`, this data will be used to send the emails from.

To startup, just do the `docker compose up` in either of the directories.

## âœ¨ Usage

After building, you will have access to new endpoint: `localhost:5000/send`, to which you can send a `POST` request that contains `json` with two fields: `user_alias` (it will say who sent the message) and `message` (the text itself).

> you can use following curl command to do just that: <br/>
> `curl -X POST --data '{"message": "message text", "user_alias": "Professor"}' --header 'Content-Type: application/json'  localhost:5000/send`

##  âœ… Monitoring

### The Event Driven Approach

The **RabbitMQ** as a message broker provides incredibly robust dashboard for tracking all messages and how much resources they use that can be accessed at `http://127.0.0.1:15672/` and rather insightful logs in docker.

### The Pipes And Filters Approach

Unlike **RabbitMQ**, it can't show off as much information, but you can still track which specific service was more likely responsible for the failure by getting back information on how far into the system your message went with json response that will look something like this:

```json
{
  "filter_response": {
    "screaming_response": {
      "publish_response": {
        "status": "Email sent"
      },
      "status": "Message forwarded"
    },
    "status": "Message forwarded"
  },
  "status": "Message forwarded"
}
```

## Overview

This report compares the performance of two architectures: an event-driven system using RabbitMQ and a Python pipes-and-filters model. Both systems process messages through filtering, transforming to uppercase, and email message publication.

## Test Summary

- **Environment**: Docker Containers
- **Metrics**: Measured time performance, CPU/memory usage.
## Results

### Time Behavior

- **Event-Driven**: 
  - Higher latency due to network overhead.

  - Average response time: ` 0.0266051 sec`.

- **Pipes-and-Filters**:
  - Lower latency with in-memory processing.
  - Average response time: ` 0.0175616 sec`.

### Resource Utilization

- **Event-Driven**:
  - Higher CPU and memory usage due to distributed processing.
  - Notable network overhead.

- **Pipes-and-Filters**:
  - Lower resource usage, limited to a single process.

### Memory & CPU

- **Event-Driven**:
Memory Usage: 233.18MB
CPU Usage: 0.07% 

- **Pipes-and-Filters**:
Memory Usage: 93.92MB 
CPU Usage: 0.007% 
## Conclusion

- **Event-Driven** is better for scalable, distributed systems but adds latency and resource costs.
- **Pipes-and-Filters** offers faster processing with lower resources for simpler tasks.
